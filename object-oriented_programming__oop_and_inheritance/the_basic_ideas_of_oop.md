## The basic Ideas of OOP

The way you structure a program  C++ is:

1.	 Split it up into a set of tasks and subtasks .
2.	 Make functions for the tasks .
3.	 Instruct the computer to perform them in sequence.

With large amounts of data and/or large numbers of tasks, this makes for complex and
unmaintainable programs.

To manage this complexity, itâ€™s nicer to package up self-sufficient, modular pieces of code.OOP allows programmers to pack away details
into neat, self-contained boxes (objects) so that they can think of the objects more abstractly
and focus on the interactions between them.

There are lots of definitions for OOP, but 3 primary features of it are:

-	 Encapsulation: grouping related data and functions together as objects and defining
an interface to those objects.


- Inheritance: allowing code to be reused between related types .



- Polymorphism: allowing a value to be one of several types, and determining at
runtime which functions to call on it based on its type .
