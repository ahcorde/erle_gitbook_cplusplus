## Polymorphism

Polymorphism means “many shapes.” It refers to the ability of one object to have many
types. If we have a function that expects a Vehicle object, we can safely pass it a Car
object, because every Car is also a Vehicle. Likewise for references and pointers: anywhere
you can use a Vehicle *, you can use a Car *.
