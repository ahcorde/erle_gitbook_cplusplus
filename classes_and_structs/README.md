# Classes and structs
---
In C++, the concept of structure has been generalized in an object-oriented sense.
- Structures are a way of storing many different values in variables of potentially different types under the same name.
- Classes define types of data structures and the functions that operate on those data structures.

In this chapter we will learn about classes and structures in C++.
